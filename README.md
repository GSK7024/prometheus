# P2P Chat Application - Prometheus AI Development

This is a simple, local, command-line peer-to-peer chat application developed using Python with the help of Prometheus AI.

## Problem Fixed: Infinite Loop Prevention

The original implementation had a critical bug in the Agile development strategy that caused infinite loops. Here's what was fixed:

### Issues Identified and Fixed:

1. **Infinite Loop in Agile Strategy**: The system was repeatedly generating the same task "Diversify focus: implement story part in p2p_core.py" without making progress.

2. **File Diversification Logic Bug**: When no alternative files were available, the function would fall through without returning, causing the same logic to execute repeatedly.

3. **Task Completion Tracking**: Completed tasks weren't being properly removed from the sprint backlog, leading to duplicate task generation.

4. **Sprint Backlog Management**: Stories were not being removed from the sprint backlog when tasks were completed.

### Fixes Implemented:

#### 1. Fixed Infinite Loop in `get_next_task()` method:
```python
# Added proper handling when no alternative files exist
if alt:
    return { "task_type": TaskType.TDD_IMPLEMENTATION.value, ... }
else:
    # No alternative files available, continue with current file
    logger.info("No alternative files available for diversification, continuing with current approach")
    # Reset the main.py edit count to prevent getting stuck
    if "main.py" in self.project_state.file_activity_counts:
        self.project_state.file_activity_counts["main.py"] = 0
        logger.info("Reset main.py edit count to prevent infinite loop")
```

#### 2. Added Task Completion Tracking:
```python
# For agile strategy, remove completed stories from sprint backlog
if self.project_state.development_strategy == DevelopmentStrategy.AGILE.value:
    task_desc = task_response.get("task_description", "")
    # Remove the corresponding story from sprint backlog
    for i, story in enumerate(self.project_state.sprint_backlog):
        if story.get("description", "") in task_desc:
            self.project_state.sprint_backlog.pop(i)
            logger.info(f"Removed completed story from sprint backlog: {story.get('description', '')}")
            break
```

#### 3. Added Emergency Brake:
```python
# Maximum task execution limit to prevent infinite loops
max_tasks = getattr(config, "max_tasks_per_run", 100)

while not goal_achieved:
    # Prevent infinite loops - emergency brake
    if len(self.project_state.completed_tasks) >= max_tasks:
        logger.warning(f"Maximum task limit ({max_tasks}) reached. Stopping to prevent infinite loop.")
        break
```

#### 4. Created Required Project Files:
- `main.py`: Main entry point for the P2P chat application
- `config.py`: Configuration management
- `p2p_core.py`: Core P2P networking functionality
- `test_p2p_core.py`: Unit tests for the core functionality

### Project Structure:
```
/workspace/
├── prometheus.py          # Main AI development engine
├── main.py               # P2P Chat application entry point
├── config.py             # Configuration management
├── p2p_core.py           # Core P2P networking functionality
├── test_p2p_core.py      # Unit tests
└── README.md             # This documentation
```

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Install dependencies (if any): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

### Features:
- Local network peer-to-peer communication
- User identity management
- Real-time message transmission
- Persistent chat history storage (SQLite)
- Automatic message timestamps
- Command-line interface

### Testing:
Run the unit tests: `python -m pytest test_p2p_core.py -v`

## Prevention Measures:
The fixes ensure that:
1. ✅ No infinite loops occur in task generation
2. ✅ Completed tasks are properly tracked and removed from backlogs
3. ✅ File diversification works correctly when alternative files exist
4. ✅ Emergency brakes prevent runaway execution
5. ✅ Proper logging helps identify and debug issues

This implementation is now robust and should not get stuck in infinite loops during development.
